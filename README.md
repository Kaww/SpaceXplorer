# SpaceXplorer App

This app is fetching data from a SpaceX API made in GraphQL, accessible in `https://api.spacex.land/graphql/`. More documentation can be found [here](https://documenter.getpostman.com/view/7889102/T1LMiT13#intro).


## Apollo + iOS

I'm using Apollo to manage the GraphQL stuff on the app side, installed throught Swift Package Manager.
The setup not very complicated, but there are some tricky steps when you don't know it at all.
You should follow the [iOS setup guide](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/ios/installation/) from Apollo's official documentation, especially for the code generation script.
