# SpaceXplorer App

This app is fetching data from a SpaceX API made in GraphQL, accessible in `https://api.spacex.land/graphql/`. More documentation can be found [here](https://documenter.getpostman.com/view/7889102/T1LMiT13#intro).


## Apollo + iOS

I'm using Apollo to manage the GraphQL business on the app side, installed with Swift Package Manager.

The setup not very complicated, but I faced some tricky steps as it was new to me.

You should follow the [iOS setup guide](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/ios/installation/) from Apollo's official documentation, especially for the code generation script.
